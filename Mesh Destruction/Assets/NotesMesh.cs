what if you do go thoruohg every edge so create triangle go thgouth edge one, edge one check with all the other tri if it is share then skip it prob a for on top of a while loop

 ----------------------------------  TO DO  ----------------------------------

added perf checks and for somereason now nothing lags, there are some stutters but idk
in case it gets bad add compartimentalisation similar to the python asteroi thing

for some reason the first hit gets reset



find a nice asset pack


Game idea - i was thinking zombies tbh, the zombies walk to the window, break it

window can be repaired, if each "wall" holds a que of a list of vectors then i can just call the vectors from the latets destoyed and replenish them
