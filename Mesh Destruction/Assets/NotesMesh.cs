what if you do go thoruohg every edge so create triangle go thgouth edge one, edge one check with all the other tri if it is share then skip it prob a for on top of a while loop

 ----------------------------------  TO DO  ----------------------------------
when having the wall weirdly there are spots where the raycast doenst work

added perf checks and for somereason now nothing lags, there are some stutters but idk


find a nice asset pack


Game idea - i was thinking zombies tbh, the zombies walk to the window, break it

window can be repaired, if each "wall" holds a que of a list of vectors then i can just call the vectors from the latets destoyed and replenish them

make the signals a child of the post so they move together

or

player needs to escape and to escape he needs to break walls and stuff
